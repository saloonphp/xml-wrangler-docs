XML Wrangler is a simple wrapper around two really powerful libraries which do a lot of the legwork. Both of libraries are fantastic and deserve a star!

* [veewee/xml](https://github.com/veewee/xml) - Used for reading and decoding XML, but has a powerful writing engine of its own.
* [spatie/array-to-xml](https://github.com/spatie/array-to-xml) - A brilliant library to convert an array into XML
